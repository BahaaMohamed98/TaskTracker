# Task Tracker CLI (JDBC Practice)

This is a simple Java command-line application built to learn and practice:

- âœ… JDBC and SQL with Java
- âœ… Connection pooling with HikariCP
- âœ… In-memory and file-based databases using H2
- âœ… Clean project structure (DAO pattern, Mapper classes)
- âœ… Unit testing with JUnit 5
